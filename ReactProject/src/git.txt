 A Git snapshot is the state of the project files at a certain point in time. 
 Instead of maintaining a record of file-based changes that orcur over time, Git will store that data as a snapshot, which is the entire state of the project at that particular moment. 
 While saving the snapshot, it will keep those files that did get updated and only keep references of files that didn't change from the previous snapshot to avoid duplicates. 

 Git states: Git has three primary states that it allows the projects files to acuire. 

 1: modified: files that have been changed, but the changes have not yet been marked by Git. These changes won't become part of the next snapshot.
 2: Staged: the chagnes have been tracked by Git and will be marked as such in the next snapshot.
 3: Committed: the changes files that have successfully become part of the lasted snapshot.

 modified -> git marks file -> staged -> snapshot created -> Committed
