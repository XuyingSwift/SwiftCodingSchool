# Question 1: what is the difference between initialization and assignment?
Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created, Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the viarbale is created.
# Question 2: what form of initialization should you prefer when you want to initialize a variable with a specific value ? 
Direct list initialization
# Question 3: What are the default initialization and value initialization? What is the behavior of each? which would prefer?
Default initialization is when a variable initialization has no initializer (e.g. int x;). In most cases, the variable is left with an indeterminate value.
Value initialization is when a variable initialization has an empty brace (e.g. int x{};). In most cases this will perform zero-initialization.
You should prefer value initialization to default initialization.
