#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   // When the program is run (called runtime), the variable will be instantiated. 
   // Instantiation is a fancy word that means the object will be created and assigned a memory address.

   // A data type (more commonly just called a type) tells the compiler what type of value (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etcâ€¦) the variable will store.
    int x; // define a vairable named x, of type int.
    int a, b; // defining multiple variables
    int c; double d;
    // Best Practice
    // Although the language allows you to do so, avoiding definging multiple variable of some type in a single statement.
    // define each variable in its single line.
    return 0;
